At initial stages right now.

To-dos:
-Come up with another name --> safetyninja.com is taken
-Play sound does not  work.
-Once on the send help sms page, repeatedly sends sms ~every 30 seconds, unless back button hit
-Use Twilio API to translate sms to voice message so automates message to PSAFE
-clean up code and commenting. Unnecessary things are probably in there.
-Add circle of friends
-add general "Add phone number of School police" so this can be generalised for more school campuses,
